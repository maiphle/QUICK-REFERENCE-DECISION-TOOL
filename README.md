# QUICK-REFERENCE-DECISION-TOOL

A training material I designed and developed while working at TD Bank using JavaScript and Adobe Acrobat Pro DC to improve branchâ€™s efficiency and customer experience. 

The material was needed as a quick solution for 6 months to 1 year before new system is rolled out to entire footprint. The objective of this tool was to reinforce existing procedures and reduce 100+ weekly backlogs with a simple solution that cost $0 and virtually no learning curve in the span of 1-2 months. I originally built something similar in Powerpoint, but ended up with this method after receiving feedback that something more "bite-sized" was required to faciliate organic conversations with customers and reduce information overload.

Ideally, I would love to have designed this in Adobe InDesign which would be able to easily map all the layers and buttons.

* PDF Tool.pdf - File should display all layers correctly in any PDF readers and browser with Adobe Reader plug-ins. Otherwise, it can be run in Internet Explorer compatible mode on Microsoft Edge. 
* PDF Tool Script.txt - Snippet of script used to control the layers and buttons on the tool.

Huge thanks to random YouTube stranger that I cannot seem to locate for inspiring this project.
